# Jeopardy

Jeopardy is a popular trivia game show in the United States. The answers are given first, and the contestants are asked to supply the questions. In this project I will be working with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help someone win. The datset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/
